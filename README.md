*IDEA9103 Individual task*
![Image](assets/individual%20.png)
In my individual task, I was responsible for the Perlin noise component.
Building on the shared codebase, I applied Perlin noise to three areas:
- Breathing halos on railway stations  
- Floating rectangles in the Mondrian town  
- A dynamic ocean system including:  
  - Noise-shaped coastline  
  - Noise-driven particle flow field  

which create motion, rhythm, and natural variation—blending Mondrian geometry with the living pulse of Sydney.
##  1. Railway Stations — Breathing Halos

To enhance the railway network, I added a **Perlin-noise-driven halo animation** to each station.

The noise sampled from *(x, y, time)* controls both radius and transparency:

```js
let n = noise(x * 0.05, y * 0.05, frameCount * 0.02);
let haloR = map(n, 0, 1, dot_R * 1.5, dot_R * 4.4);
let haloA = map(n, 0, 1, 30, 80);
noFill();
stroke(red(col), green(col), blue(col), haloA);
strokeWeight(4);
circle(x, y, haloR);

```

This transforms each static station dot into a **gently breathing, pulsating light**, adding rhythmic energy to the entire map.

##  2. Mondrian Town — Floating Blocks

In the Mondrian-inspired town, Perlin noise is used to animate the **drifting movement of rectangles**.

Each block has its own noise seed and calculates drifting offsets every frame:

```js
let xNoise = noise(this.noiseLocation);
let yNoise = noise(this.noiseLocation + 10);
let maxOffset = 20;
let offsetX = (xNoise - 0.5) * 2 * maxOffset * this.noiseScale;
let offsetY = (yNoise - 0.5) * 2 * maxOffset * this.noiseScale;
let cx = this.baseX + offsetX;
let cy = this.baseY + offsetY;
rect(cx - this.w / 2, cy - this.h / 2, this.w, this.h);

this.noiseLocation += 0.018;

```

The result is a **soft floating effect**: blocks gently drift left and right, up and down, injecting a subtle sense of motion into the rigid Mondrian geometry.

##  3. Sea — Noise-Shaped Coastline & Particle Flow

### (1) Coastline generated with Perlin noise

The coastline is generated by offsetting points along the vertical axis using Perlin noise:

```js
let n = noise(y * 0.02, tNoise);
let coastX = SEA_X_MIN + coastOffset + (n - 0.5) * 2 * coastAmplitude;
```

This technique produces a **natural, wavering shoreline** that slowly shifts over time, making the sea border feel alive.

### (2) Particle flow field driven by 3D noise

The sea is animated using a noise-driven vector field.  
Each particle computes its direction using 3D Perlin noise:

```js
let n = noise(
  p.x * 0.006,
  p.y * 0.006,
  frameCount * 0.01 + p.noiseOffset
);
let angle = n * TWO_PI + PI;
let vx = cos(angle) * p.speed;
let vy = sin(angle) * p.speed;
```

This creates a **smooth, organic water-flow effect**, where each particle moves naturally instead of jittering randomly.

The particles also change color based on horizontal position using a shallow-to-deep ocean gradient, enhancing depth and realism.
